# Isomorphic Mullet

Facebook in the front, Walmart in teh back :) This is a simple fork of isomorphic-react-boilerplate using Hapi.js on the back-end instead of Express... a Sunday night project.

##To-Do-List
1. Add SASS compilation
1. Add bootstrap components [react-bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
1. Add [browser-sync]((http://www.browsersync.io/)), in addition to [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for development 
1. Spin up a Hapi connection to support [socket.io](http://socket.io/).


Special thank you to svenanders for his awesome [isomorphic-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/svenanders/isomorphic-react-boilerplate).  Beautiful architecture and perfect toolset in my opinion. This project is a fork.  In addition, I've listed several other invaluable references I've used along the way.

*Note: I almost titled this repo "Isomorphic [Mullet](https://github.com/lynnaloo/mullet)"


Install with
